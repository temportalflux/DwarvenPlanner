DwarvenPlanner
-----

This project is still in the concepting phase.

Goals:
- Easy tracking of the storage for DwarvenForge set pieces
- Enable users to create maps and be able to store their format digitially so they can be recreated later
- Bonus: Preview maps in the previewer
- Bonus: Plan out maps using both pieces owned and unowned
